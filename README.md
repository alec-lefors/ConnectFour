# ConnectFour

This java game is a graphical implementation of Connect Four. It utilizes the JFrame class and is a series of 42 JLabels and 7 JButtons. Each space is a single image containing a empty, red, or yellow space.

# How to Play

Red will always go first when the game starts. The players will use the mouse to hover over and select a column to place their tile. When a player wins a match, a dialog box will appear and ask to start a new match. Yes will reset the gameboard and no will exit the application, closing the dialog box will leave the gameboard intact until you either close the game or click on a column.
